## Objective

We have used subset of the data avilable at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
to create a tidy dataset. The original information available for the input variables at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones is still valid but the data transformation is highlighted in this document. In the study 30 individuals undertook six activities and 561 features were recorded.

## Transformations

The data set is stored in the UCI HAR Dataset/ directory.
 
 Gave appropriate labels to the variables in the train and test dataset from the feautres vector.
 
 Activity ids were replaced by their corresponding names in the datasets created from y_train.txt and y_test.txt. Also the column was labelled as 'Activity'. 
 
 The datasets created from train_subject.txt and test_subject.txt were given the label of 'Subject'
 
 Regular expression was used to restrict the training and test datasets to the columns with mean() and std().
 
 The columns  of subject, activity and data were combined to produce a unified dataset for both test and training.
 
 These restricted datasets were combined to produce the restricted merged dataset of measures of interest.
 
 Melt/Cast were used to find mean for subject/activity for each measure.
 
 The tidydata.txt was produced from the above transformations.
 
 The final tidy dataset has 180 observations (30 subjects times 6 activities each) and 66 features with subject and activity as the identifiers (180 X 68) The sample output is:
